        <p>Born in New York and educated at Colgate University and Columbia University School of Law, Bruce Buck has been a Chelsea supporter since coming to London in 1983 and a season ticket holder since 1991.</p>

        <p>During his chairmanship of Chelsea, the club has enjoyed the most successful period in our history with the winning of five Premier League titles, five FA Cups, three League Cups, the Europa League and, for the first time by a team from the city he has made his home, the Champions League.</p>

        <p>However as well as working on the development of the club into a major player on the world football stage, Buck has also devoted energy to the club's history with the founding of the Past Players' Trust which raises money for former players and staff in need of medical or financial assistance.</p>

        <p>Away from Chelsea, Buck is the former managing partner for Europe for the US law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom where his work included a broad range of mergers, acquisitions and capital markets transactions.</p>

        <p>In 2012 he was named in The Times list of the UK's most influential lawyers. He was also named one of the two most high-profile lawyers in the UK by The Lawyer in 2009.</p>
